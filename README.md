# HMR2300-Magnetometer-MATLAB
A MATLAB library for working with the HMR2300 Magnetometer from Honeywell.

I am uploading here some of the codes I used to work with the HMR2300 3-axis magnetometer manufactured by Honeywell.

The functions are reasonably well commented, so I will leave this readme as small as possible by now. When I have some time, I will update here a cool readme. 

Some tags to facilitate searchs: HMR2300, HMR 2300, 3-axis magnetometer, MATLAB, data acquisition, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kennobi
